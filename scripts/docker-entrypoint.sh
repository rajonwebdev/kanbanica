# Role dispatcher for the Kanbanica image.
#
# The image fills three roles (web server, pg-boss worker, one-shot migration).
# Docker Compose picks one per service with `command:`, and anything passed that
# way is exec'd verbatim by the pass-through below — so the three-service setup
# behaves exactly as it did before this script existed.
#
# A platform that deploys the image ONCE from a registry URL (Dokploy, Coolify,
# CapRover, a bare `docker run`) has no `command:` to set. Before this script it
# therefore got the web server alone: no migrations, and no worker — which means
# no outgoing email at all, so magic-link sign-in silently never arrives. That is
# what the `all` role below fixes: one container that migrates, serves, and runs
# exactly one worker.
#
#   KANBANICA_ROLE=all      (default) migrate, then web server + worker together
#   KANBANICA_ROLE=app      web server only
#   KANBANICA_ROLE=worker   worker only
#   KANBANICA_ROLE=migrate  apply migrations, then exit
#
#   KANBANICA_RUN_MIGRATIONS=false  skip the migration step (managed database
#                                   whose app user may not run DDL). Defaults to
#                                   true for `all`/`migrate`, false otherwise.
#
# bash, not sh: `wait -n PID` (used to notice either child dying) needs bash 5.1+
# and the base image is node:22-bookworm-slim, which ships bash 5.2.

# Call the .bin shims instead of `pnpm start` / `pnpm worker:start`: a pnpm
# wrapper per child costs another Node process and puts another hop between
# Docker's SIGTERM and the process that has to act on it. Both `next` and `tsx`
# are production dependencies, so these exist in the image's --prod node_modules.
